1. The approach I will be taking is the sorting method.
2. The first thing I will be checking is whether they 2 string have the same size, since if they don't, you already know they aren't valid anagrams.
3. Then I will sort the string using the in built sorting method for java and python (O(nlogn))
4. Then I will compare the elements from one string to the other to see if they have the same string.
5. If they do, return true, else return false.
