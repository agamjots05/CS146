**Problem 1 Explanation**
1. n^3 since n^3 is asymptotically greater than n^2
2. n^2logn is greater since n^2 grows much greater than nlog^10n
3. Honestly I wasn't able to figure this out without using a graphing calculator which I found the n^log(n) is asmypotically greater.
4. 4^n is asmptotically greater than 2^n

**Problem 2 Explanation**
1. Best Case: O(1) this happens when you're looking at values 0,1,2. As it doesnt fulfill the initial condition
2. Worst Case: O(sqrt(n)) This is because you're doing the condition i*i <= n which means that at most it will go to the sqaure root of i.
3. Avg Case: Also O(sqrt(n)) This is because the best case covers so little amount of the capable sample size, which means that you'll tend to hit the worst case majority of the times.
