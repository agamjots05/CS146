1. In this solution I used the two pointer method.
2. I started with the first pointer at the first index and the second pointer had the starting value of 1 + 
the first pointer
3. Using nested for loops I checked the addition of each combination possible within the array until I found the
value I'm looking for.
4. Otherwise return -1 if you don't find. 
5. Overall runtime for this method is o(n) average and worst case.
