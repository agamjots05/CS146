1. My idea was to use a binary search to find the solution to this problem.
2. I will start from the middle of the array and check whether this is a bad version.
3. If it isnt a bad version then I will check the right side of the array.
4. If it is a bad version then I will check the left side.
5. You will continue until you find the first bad version.
