1. You want to start by creating a queue and adding your root to this queue to initialize the process.
2. Now you will create a while loop that continues until the queue is empty
3. Now you want to create a new arraylist that stores the row you're currently looking at.
4. Now you want to store the size of this queue before you do anything.
6. Now you want to make a for loop that continues for the size of the queue you have made in step 4. This for loop will dequeue the element and add it to the arraylist. At the same time you will add the children of the popped elements into the queue.
7. Then you will add this arraylist to the main array list of array lists's once the for loop is over.
8. This while loop will repeat till all elements are added each of their designated array lists. Then you finally just return the completed solution of array lists.
