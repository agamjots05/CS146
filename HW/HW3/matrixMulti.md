1. For this algorithm the time complexity is O(A*B*C) where A is the number of rows in matrix A, B is the number of rows in matrix B, and C is the number of columns in matrix A.
2. This is the case because you can see 3 nested for loops being used within this algorithm.
3. So overall if these are both square matrixs, the overall time complexity will be O(n^3), where n is the number of columns/rows for matrix A and B.
4. Due to its time complexity this algorithm is really slow when you start increasing the size of the matrices.
