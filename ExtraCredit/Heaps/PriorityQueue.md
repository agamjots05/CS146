Part 1 Using With Max Heaps Pseudocode
1. We can use heaps as a priority queue, for max heap you can insert by adding it to the end of the array then heapifying it upwards.
2. And to remove an element you can swap the last element with the root and heapify it down and finally remove the last element.

To use Heapify with a min heap is to do the same operations in reverse heapify since you want the smaller elements to be at the top instead of the bottom in the case of a max heap.
