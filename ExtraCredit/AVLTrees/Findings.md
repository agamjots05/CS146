1. I think this data structure is pretty interesting because as compared to the color importance with redBlack trees, this data structure uses the value of the height of a node to sort them out.
2. I'm also kinda shocked how people came up with this during 1960's. Its crazy how people came up with this idea.
3. Although this is a new kind of implementation for a self balancing tree, it isn't as widely used as redblack trees.
4. Another problem is that it takes much more processing to balance this tree.
5. However AVL trees are used where insertion and deletion is less used and you need to find elements. this is mainly used inside in-memory collections including sets and dictonaries.
